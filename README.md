> **Record Your Masterpiece** - The ultimate Photoshop timelapse plugin designed for digital artists and speedpainters.

PSFlow is a native Photoshop plugin that automatically records your entire creative process without capturing the whole screen. Focus on your art while PSFlow intelligently captures every stroke, creating perfect timelapse videos ready to share.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Canvas-Only Recording** - Captures only your artwork, ignoring Photoshop UI panels, zooming, and panning
- ⚡ **No Extra Software** - Runs entirely inside Photoshop as a native plugin, no OBS or QuickTime needed
- 🚀 **Instant Video Generation** - Export your timelapse directly to MP4 with customizable settings
- 🤖 **Smart Detection** - Automatically detects canvas changes and pauses when you're idle
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support** - Available in multiple languages for global artists
- 💾 **Storage Efficient** - Configurable recording intervals to optimize storage usage

## 🎬 How It Works

### Step 1: Start Recording

Open the PSFlow panel in Photoshop (`Window > Extensions > PSFlow`) and click the record button. It runs silently in the background while you focus on your art.

### Step 2: Create Your Art

Paint, sketch, and design as usual. PSFlow captures every stroke intelligently, pausing automatically when you are idle.

### Step 3: Export Video

Done? Click stop and choose your export settings. Get a high-quality MP4 file instantly, ready to share on social media.
